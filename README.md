Fast computation of the distance covariance `dcov` and distance correlation `dcor`. The computation cost is only O(n log(n)) for the distance correlation (see Chaudhuri, Hu, 2019, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11332), [elsevier](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2019.01.016)). The functions are written entirely in C++ to speed up the computation.
