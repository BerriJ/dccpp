Description: Fast computation of the distance covariance \code{dcov} and distance correlation \code{dcor}.  The computation cost is only O(n log(n)) for the distance correlation (see Chaudhuri, Hu, 2019, <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2019.01.016>). The functions are written entirely in C++ to speed up the computation.
